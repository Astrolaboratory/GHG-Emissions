# GHG Emission Dashboard 🌍📊

## Overview  
The **GHG Emission Dashboard** is a data visualization project designed for ESG domain companies to help product-based organizations analyze and manage their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, cost savings, and sustainability initiatives. Leveraging Python for data generation and Tableau for interactive dashboards, this project offers actionable insights into emission trends, sources, and financial impacts.

## 🎯 **Project Objectives**  
1. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Provide a clear overview of emissions, emissions by source, comprehensive reports, and cost savings.  
2. **Benchmarking:** Compare company emissions with industry competitors.  
3. **Source Analysis:** Break down emissions by energy, transportation, and waste.  
4. **GHG Composition:** Visualize the distribution of emissions by GHG types (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O).  
5. **Temporal Trends:** Analyze quarterly emissions patterns from 2020 to 2023.  
6. **Financial Impact:** Track spending and savings tied to emission reduction efforts.

## 🚀 **Dataset**  
Since no suitable public dataset was available, a synthetic dataset was created using Python. Key variables include:  
- **Company Emissions:** Measured in tons of CO2 equivalent.  
- **Emissions by Source:** Energy, transportation, waste, and other categories.  
- **Emissions by GHG Type:** CO2, CH4, N2O, etc.  
- **Cost Data:** Expenditures and savings (in USD).  
- **Quarterly Data:** Covering 2020–2023.

## 🔍 **Dashboard Features**  
The interactive dashboard, developed in Tableau, answers critical questions related to GHG emissions and their financial implications. Key features include:  
1. **KPIs Overview:** Total emissions, source-specific emissions, reports, and cost savings.  
2. **Benchmarking Performance:** Compare emissions performance with competitors.  
3. **Source Analysis:** Deep dive into emission sources like energy and transportation.  
4. **GHG Composition:** Distribution of emissions by different gases.  
5. **Quarterly Trends:** Visualization of emissions and cost trends over time.  
6. **Impact of Sustainability Efforts:** Highlights the emissions dip and cost savings achieved through transitioning to recycled materials in 2023.
